# 100 Days of Code

Inspired by #The100DayProject kicked off by Elle Luna & The Great Discontent (https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days) and Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days (https://jenniferdewalt.com/)

I am focusing on JavaScript and learning a little every dayâ€”slowly getting closer to building out my ideas.

I'm forgoing posting on Instagram and my blog everyday to spend more of my finite time on code, but I am going to start working on little weekly projects in addition to these skill builder problems and will post them. [http://www.blikethat.com/100days/](http://www.blikethat.com/100days/)
